We need to design a program that takes an integer `k` as input and reads packets. The program should continuously maintain a uniform random subset of size `k` from the data received.

### Assumptions:
1. We assume that the input packets are continuous and arrive in a stream.
2. Each packet is read one at a time.
3. Once we reach `k` packets, we need to maintain a uniform random subset of these `k` packets.
4. If new packets arrive after we have already reached `k`, they should be added to the subset randomly with equal probability.

### Brute Force Approach:
1. Initialize an empty set to store the subset.
2. As each packet arrives, check if the set size is less than `k`.
   - If it is, add the packet to the set.
   - If it is not, replace a random element in the set with the new packet.

### Optimization (Tradeoff ++ Big-O):
- The brute force approach has an average time complexity of O(1) for each insertion because replacing a random element can be done in constant time. However, the space complexity is O(k), which is acceptable for fixed `k`.
- If we want to optimize further and reduce memory usage, we could use a reservoir sampling algorithm, but it would have a slightly higher implementation complexity.

### Edge Cases:
1. What happens if `k` is larger than the total number of packets? We need to handle this case gracefully.
2. What if there are fewer packets than `k` initially? The program should maintain all available packets in the subset.
3. What if the stream of packets ends and we still have packets in the subset?

### APIs/Classes (if needed):
- No specific external libraries are required for this problem.

### Architecture/Data Model:
1. **Data Structure:** We will use a `Set` to store the current uniform random subset.
2. **State Variables:**
   - `k`: The size of the subset.
   - `currentSubset`: A set containing the current subset of packets.

### Dry Run:
Let's simulate the program with `k = 3` and assume we have the following sequence of packet arrivals:

1. `a`
2. `t`
3. `a`
4. `d`
5. `f`
6. `o`

- After the first three packets (`a`, `t`, `a`), the subset will be `{a, t, a}`.
- When the fourth packet (`d`) arrives, we replace one of the elements randomly (let's say `a`) with `d`. The subset becomes `{d, t, a}`.
- When the fifth packet (`f`) arrives, we replace another element randomly (let's say `t`) with `f`. The subset becomes `{d, f, a}`.
- When the sixth packet (`o`) arrives, we replace one of the elements randomly (let's say `a`) with `o`. The subset becomes `{d, f, o}`.

### Final Java Code/Solution:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Set;

public class PacketSubsetMaintainer {
    private Set<String> currentSubset;
    private int k;
    private Random random;

    public PacketSubsetMaintainer(int k) {
        this.k = k;
        this.currentSubset = new HashSet<>();
        this.random = new Random();
    }

    public void addPacket(String packet) {
        if (currentSubset.size() < k) {
            currentSubset.add(packet);
        } else {
            int indexToRemove = random.nextInt(k);
            String removedElement = null;
            for (String element : currentSubset) {
                if (indexToRemove == 0) {
                    removedElement = element;
                    break;
                }
                indexToRemove--;
            }
            currentSubset.remove(removedElement);
            currentSubset.add(packet);
        }
    }

    public Set<String> getCurrentSubset() {
        return new HashSet<>(currentSubset); // Return a copy to prevent modification
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PacketSubsetMaintainer maintainer = new PacketSubsetMaintainer(3);
        String[] packets = {"a", "t", "a", "d", "f", "o"};
        
        for (String packet : packets) {
            maintainer.addPacket(packet);
            System.out.println("Current Subset: " + maintainer.getCurrentSubset());
        }
    }
}
```
