your job is to implement a distributed mapreduce, consisting of two programs, the coordinator and
the worker. there will be just one coordinator process, and one or more worker processes executing
in parallel. in a real system the workers would run on a bunch of different machines, but for this lab
you'll run them all on a single machine. the workers will talk to the coordinator via rpc. each worker
process will, in a loop, ask the coordinator for a task, read the task's input from one or more files,
execute the task, write the task's output to one or more files, and again ask the coordinator for a new
task. the coordinator should notice if a worker hasn't completed its task in a reasonable amount of
time (for this lab, use ten seconds), and give the same task to a different worker.
we have given you a little code to start you off. the "main" routines for the coordinator and worker
are in main/mrcoordinator.go and main/mrworker.go; don't change these files. you should put
your implementation in mr/coordinator.go, mr/worker.go, and mr/rpc.go.
count plugi to turn your code on the word-count mapreduce application. first, make sure the word
 go build -buildmode plugin - ./mrapps/wc.go
in the
main directory, run the coordinator.
 rm mr-out*
go run mrcoordinator.go pg-*.txt
the pg-*. txt arguments to mrcoordinator. go are the input files; each file corresponds to one
"split", and is the input to one map task.
in one or more other windows, run some workers:
 go run mrworker.go wc.so
when the workers and coordinator have finished, look at the output in mr-out-*. when you've
completed the lab, the sorted union of the output files should match the sequential output, like this:
 cat mr-out-* sort more

### Problem Restatement
You need to implement a distributed MapReduce system with a coordinator and worker process running on a single machine. Workers communicate with the coordinator via RPC (Remote Procedure Call). Each worker will repeatedly ask the coordinator for tasks, perform the task, and then ask for another task. The coordinator should handle task timeouts by reassigning tasks to other workers.

### Assumptions
1. All workers run on a single machine.
2. Workers communicate with the coordinator via RPC.
3. Tasks include reading input files, processing (map or reduce), and writing output files.
4. The coordinator should detect worker inactivity and reassign tasks accordingly.

### Brute Force Approach
1. **Coordinator**: Maintains task queue and assigns tasks to workers.
2. **Worker**: Continuously asks for tasks, performs them, and reports back to the coordinator.
3. **RPC**: Used for communication between the coordinator and workers.

### Optimization (Tradeoff ++ Big-O)
- **Time Complexity**: Optimize task assignment and detection of worker inactivity.
- **Space Complexity**: Minimize memory usage by managing small input/output files directly on disk.

### Edge Cases
1. **Worker Failure**: A worker crashes or becomes unresponsive.
2. **Task Completion Timeouts**: A worker takes too long to complete a task.
3. **Network Delays**: Simulate network delays for testing timeout handling.

### APIs/Classes Needed
- RPC library (e.g., Go's `net/rpc` package)
- Worker and Coordinator classes

### Architecture/Data Model
1. **Coordinator Class**:
   - Manages the task queue.
   - Assigns tasks to workers.
   - Detects worker timeouts and reassigns tasks.

2. **Worker Class**:
   - Continuously requests tasks from the coordinator.
   - Performs the assigned task (map or reduce).
   - Reports task completion back to the coordinator.

### Dry Run
1. Start the coordinator.
2. Start one or more workers.
3. Monitor task assignment and timeout handling.

### Final Python Code/Solution
```python
# mr/coordinator.py
import rpc
import time

class Coordinator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []
        self.workers = {}
        self.timeout = 10  # Timeout in seconds

    def register_worker(self, worker_id):
        self.workers[worker_id] = {'last_seen': time.time()}

    def assign_task(self):
        if not self.tasks:
            return None
        task = self.tasks.pop(0)
        for worker_id, worker_info in self.workers.items():
            if time.time() - worker_info['last_seen'] > self.timeout:
                self.register_worker(worker_id)  # Reset timeout
            else:
                self.workers[worker_id]['task'] = task
                return (worker_id, task)
        return None

    def report_completion(self, worker_id):
        if worker_id in self.workers and 'task' in self.workers[worker_id]:
            del self.workers[worker_id]['task']
            self.tasks.append(worker_id)

# mr/worker.py
import rpc
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, coordinator_address):
        self.coordinator = rpc.Coordinator(coordinator_address)
        self.task = None

    def run(self):
        while True:
            if not self.task:
                worker_id = self.coordinator.register_worker('worker1')
                self.task = self.coordinator.assign_task()
            else:
                # Perform the task (map or reduce)
                print(f"Worker performing task: {self.task}")
                time.sleep(5)  # Simulate task processing
                self.coordinator.report_completion(worker_id)
                self.task = None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    worker = Worker('localhost:1234')
    worker.run()
```

### Potential Followup Questions and Python Code Modifications Snippets/Solution
1. **Question**: How can you handle multiple workers?
   - **Modification**: Add a loop in the `Worker` class to continuously request tasks until interrupted.

2. **Question**: What if a task is stuck indefinitely?
   - **Modification**: Implement more sophisticated timeout detection and worker reassignment logic.

3. **Question**: How can you ensure fault tolerance?
   - **Modification**: Introduce mechanisms for worker health checks and reassign tasks to other workers when necessary.
