# interview-triumph

Must-have patterns:

Arrays & Strings: sliding window, two pointers, prefix sum

Hashing: frequency maps, set lookups

Stack/Queue: monotonic stack, queue with two stacks

Binary Search: on arrays, on answer (search space reduction)

Recursion + Backtracking: subsets, permutations, sudoku solver

Dynamic Programming: 1D (climb stairs), 2D (grid path, knapsack)

Graphs: BFS, DFS, topological sort, union-find

Heaps/Priority Queue: k elements, scheduling, median

Design: LRU cache, rate limiter, hashmap, queue with stacks

👉 You already asked me to prepare LLD/system design — add these coding designs (HashMap, Queue, LRU, Logger rate limiter). They show both coding + design thinking.

🔑 Step 2. 2-Hour Daily Routine (Non-Negotiable)

Since interviews are close, this routine balances practice + recall + dry run.

(A) 30 mins – Recall Review

Pick 2 patterns. Recall solution templates from memory (without coding).

Example: LRU Cache → HashMap + Doubly Linked List.

Talk it out loud (like interview mode).

(B) 1 hr – Solve 2 problems

One easy/medium (to warm up).

One medium/hard (stretch).

Use LeetCode/GeeksforGeeks. Set timer: 20–25 mins per problem.

(C) 30 mins – Dry Run & Edge Cases

Take your code, dry run on custom input.

Check edge cases (empty input, max constraints).

This is where you usually lose points → practicing this will help you sound confident in interviews.

🔑 Step 3. Mock “Interview Mode”

At least 3 times a week:

Set 45 min timer.

Pick one random problem.

Speak out loud: intuition → brute force → optimize → code → dry run.

This simulates the actual panel environment.

I can give you ready interview prompts to practice with a “spoken answer + code.”

🔑 Step 4. Focused Problem Set (30–40 problems total)

Not random practice — just these:

Arrays/Strings: Two Sum, Longest Substring, Kadane’s, Rotate Array, Product Except Self

Hash/Set: Group Anagrams, Valid Sudoku, Subarray Sum = K

Stack/Queue: Min Stack, Daily Temperatures, Sliding Window Maximum

Binary Search: Search Rotated Array, Median of Two Sorted Arrays

DP: House Robber, Coin Change, Longest Increasing Subsequence

Graph: Course Schedule, Number of Islands, Clone Graph

Design: LRU Cache, Logger Rate Limiter, HashMap, Task Scheduler

👉 Master these ~35, and you’ll handle 80% of questions in interviews.

🔑 Step 5. Leverage Your Strength in System Design

Even if your coding round is “average,” strong system design rounds can still push you across the line. You already shine there — notification system, scheduler, booking system, distributed queue — keep those crisp and practiced.

⚡ Quick Win Hack for this week (since interviews are already lined up):

Day 1–2: Revise all design/coding templates (HashMap, Queue, LRU, Scheduler).

Day 3–5: Solve only top 10 medium LeetCode (I’ll list exact links if you want).

Every night: 15-min dry run aloud of one old problem → builds interview “flow.”
