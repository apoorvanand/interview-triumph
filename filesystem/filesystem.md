Here are several implementation-based problems for file systems and operating systems (OS) operations, suitable for a Software Engineering (SWE) interview.

## File System Problems üìÅ

These problems focus on the data structures and algorithms used to manage files and directories.

### 1. **Implement a File System in Memory**
You're asked to build a simple in-memory file system. This involves designing data structures for files (storing content and metadata) and directories (storing references to files and other directories). The core operations to implement are:
* `create(path, content)`: Creates a new file at a given path.
* `read(path)`: Reads the content of a file.
* `write(path, content)`: Writes to an existing file.
* `mkdir(path)`: Creates a new directory.
* `ls(path)`: Lists the contents of a directory.

This problem tests your understanding of **tree data structures** and path traversal.

### 2. **File Defragmentation**
Given a simulated disk with blocks and files fragmented across it, design an algorithm to **defragment** the disk. This means rearranging file blocks to be contiguous, thereby improving read/write performance. You'll need to manage a list of free and used blocks.

This problem is about **space management** and **optimization algorithms**. It requires careful planning of data movement to minimize I/O overhead.

### 3. **Implement a Simple `grep` Utility**
Write a function that searches for a specific string pattern within a file or a set of files in a directory tree. Your implementation should handle:
* Searching within a single file.
* Recursively searching through subdirectories.
* Case-insensitive search.
* Counting the number of matches.

This problem tests your ability to handle **file I/O**, **directory traversal**, and **string searching algorithms** (e.g., KMP or simple substring search).

### 4. **File Compression and Decompression**
Implement a simple compression algorithm, like **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**, or a more advanced one, like a simplified **Huffman coding**, to compress a file. Then, write the corresponding decompression function.

This tests your knowledge of **data compression algorithms** and your ability to manage bit-level operations and file streams.

## Operating System Operations Problems ‚öôÔ∏è

These problems delve into the core concepts of OS, such as process management, memory allocation, and concurrency.

### 5. **LRU Cache (Least Recently Used)**
Implement a **Least Recently Used (LRU) cache** with `O(1)` time complexity for both `get` and `put` operations. The cache has a fixed capacity. When a new item is added and the cache is full, the least recently used item is evicted.

This is a classic problem that tests your ability to combine a **hash map** (for fast lookups) and a **doubly linked list** (for `O(1)` updates to usage order). This mirrors how an OS manages memory pages in a cache. 

---

### 6. **Thread Pool Implementation**
Design and implement a **thread pool** with a fixed number of worker threads. The pool should manage a queue of tasks. When a new task is submitted, it's added to the queue. An idle worker thread picks a task from the queue and executes it.

This problem tests your understanding of **concurrency primitives** like locks, semaphores, and condition variables. It's a fundamental concept in building scalable, multi-threaded applications.

---

### 7. **Memory Allocator**
Implement a simple memory allocator (like `malloc` and `free` in C). You are given a large block of memory, and you must design functions to allocate and deallocate smaller chunks. Your allocator should handle **fragmentation** and reuse freed memory. A common approach is using a **linked list of free blocks**.

This is a challenging problem that requires a deep understanding of **memory management** and pointer manipulation.

---

### 8. **Implement a Simple Scheduler**
Design a basic process scheduler. You can choose a scheduling algorithm like **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** or **Round-Robin**. Your scheduler should manage a queue of processes, execute them, and handle context switching.

This problem tests your knowledge of **process management** and your ability to model state transitions (running, ready, blocked) and manage queues of tasks.
